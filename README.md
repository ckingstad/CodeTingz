CK's Codes

I am no coding pro here - so room for error and deveolpment! 
Feel free to utilize code as I most likely utilized from others or found wonderful references. 

Nothing in my code should be in malice but if it should please note that you should dig into packages before using and use at your own risk (just in case).
